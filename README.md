# Musico - Open Source Project

Apple disables you to open any music extension with built in Music app. Imagine you have an mp3 file in Whatsapp, You can easily transfer to Musico and continue listening.

Musico supports many music extensions.

All you need to have your app supported different file extensions is to add Document Content Type Identifiers in info.plist. more info at: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/understanding_utis/understand_utis_conc/understand_utis_conc.html

We are cautious about some aspects so some features are yet to enable.




# Musico is available in Biggboss Repository and you can install it after jaimlbraking your iPhone or iPad.
